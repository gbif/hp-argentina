The IMBIV shares the first images of its specimens in GBIF

The [**Multidisciplinary Institute of Plant Biology - IMBIV**](https://museobotanico.unc.edu.ar/herbario) is a research center created in 1983, through an agreement between CONICET and the National University of CÃ³rdoba . Among its facilities is the **CORD Herbarium**.

The [**CORD Herbarium**](https://museobotanico.unc.edu.ar/herbario), due to the number and quality of the collections in general and the types of materials in particular, is one of the most important from Argentina where its main function is to serve as a reference in research. The three families best represented in the herbarium are Poaceae, Asteraceae and Solanaceae.
