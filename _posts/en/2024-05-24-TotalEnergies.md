Total Energies, a private company, is going to share data about Argentina

# New Publisher: Total Energies

We are pleased to introduce our new collaborator [**Total Energies**](https://totalenergies.com/). It is a French company that produces and markets energy on a global scale: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewable energy and electricity. 

[See the data sets published in GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/es/dataset/search?publishing_org=728e3362-3063-4a43-a6cf-71d61b50025b){:target="_blank" .button .is -primary}

## Primary biodiversity data that **Total Energies** will make open access

Through the [GBIF French Node](https://www.gbif.org/es/country/FR/summary), **Total Energies** becomes a [GBIF publisher](https://www.gbif.org/es/publisher/728e3362-3063-4a43-a6cf-71d61b50025b) from 2019.

**Total Energies** shares primary biodiversity data that has been generated during its work in different countries, whether from collected material, observations made by people or captured by camera traps.
