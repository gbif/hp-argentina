## Citizen Science Data Sets: the citizen contribution to science

The primary biodiversity data that are recorded in citizen science platforms are also aggregated in this Biodiversity portal of Argentina. They come from two global initiatives, one that focuses on birds **eBird Argentina**, from the **eBird** network and another that records both flora, fauna and fungi **ArgentiNat**, from the **iNaturalist** network. 


## About eBird Argentina

**eBird** is a Citizen Science project started in 2002 by the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology. Its purpose is to form a global network of bird watchers, who report observations, photos and sounds to a centralized and freely accessible database. In Argentina it is managed by **Aves Argentinas**

In 2013, the **eBird Argentina** portal was established. To maintain a reliable platform with good quality data, eBird added numerous reviewers to its team, as well as people who collaborate and edit, the majority being recognized ornithologists both in their region and in the country. Thanks to his ad-honorem work, the platform has experienced substantial improvement in recent years.

## About ArgentiNat

**ArgentiNat** is the national **iNaturalist** portal for Argentina. It is a Citizen Science project started in 2008 as a final Master's thesis by three students (Ken-ichi Ueda, Nate Agrin and Jessica Kline) from the Berkeley School of Information. As time went by, the project added collaborators, it depended on the California Academy of Sciences and then on National Geographic. Since 2023 it has been transformed into a non-profit organization. In Argentina, managed by **Fundaci√≥n Vida Silvestre Argentina** since 2019.
