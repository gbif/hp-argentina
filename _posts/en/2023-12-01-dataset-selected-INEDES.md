Team dedicated to the study of edaphic biota of the INEDES is recognized in the GBIF call

The [**Institute of Ecology and Sustainable Development, INEDES**](https://inedes.conicet.gov.ar/) is an institute that aims to achieve a solid regional presence to be recognized as a reference in environmental problems by agricultural producers, municipalities, managers and society in general.

Within the objectives of **INEDES**, scientific research aimed at the protection, conservation, handling and management of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems prevails. Research and development of sustainable agricultural and industrial production technologies. Research, promotion and generation of alternative energy sources. The design and modeling of future scenarios produced by global climate change and the generation of useful knowledge both for scientific and technological fields and for political decision makers, for the management of natural resources.

## Selected Data Papers
Two datapapers were selected to participate in the _Dig deep and share_ series and be published free of charge in open access: [**A georeferenced database of the edaphic biota currently available for Argentina**](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/113079/) and [**Size spectra of the edaphic fauna of typical Argiudol soils of the Rolling Pampa Region, Argentina**](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/113074/)

## Call to publish datapapers

In collaboration with the [Finnish Biodiversity Information Fund (FinBIF)](https://laji.fi/en) and [Pensoft Publishers](https://pensoft.net/), GBIF has announced a new call for Authors submit and publish soil biodiversity data articles in a special collection of [_Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ)_](https://bdj.pensoft.net/).
In line with the funding priorities of this call, at least 80 percent of the records in a dataset must contain records on soil biodiversity. These species/taxa are broadly defined as individuals that spend at least one stage of a life cycle on the ground. Other associations with the soil (such as trophic links, temporary refuge rather than permanent habitat) will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the handling editors.
