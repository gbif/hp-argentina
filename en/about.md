## About us
The **Argentine Network of Biological Data and Collections (RADyCB)** is made up of various institutions that produce primary biodiversity data and that are shared openly. These institutions have a very broad nature, from natural science museums, research institutes, different government organizations (municipal, provincial, national) to non-governmental organizations.

## Purpose 
The **RADyCB** promotes the generation, management, publication and reuse of primary biodiversity data in an open and free manner. Our data follows the **Darwin Core standard** and is governed by the **FAIR Principles**, that is, the data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The data are transparently attributed to the institutions that produce and publish them, through the **Argentina Biodiversity Portal**.

## Our history
At the end of the 90's, representatives of the main natural science collections met and gave rise to the **National Network of Biological Collections (RNCB)**. Later, in 2002, in the halls of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences (MACN), the first meetings were held to participate in GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Infrastructure), and form the **GBIF Argentine Node**. In 2009, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation introduced the **National Biological Data System (SNDB)**, which remained active until the end of 2020. Subsequently, the members of the Argentine GBIF node continued their activity , forming the **Argentine Network of Biological Data and Collections**.

## Technology
The **Argentina Biodiversity Portal** is based on the technology developed by GBIF with its [Hosted Portals] program (https://www.gbif.org/es/hosted-portals) with design and content produced by the **RADyCB**.
